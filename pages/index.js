              The Strait of Hormuz handles approximately 20% of global oil flow. Its effective closure — triggered by the US–Iran
              conflict that began February 28 — has produced a supply shock that US domestic production cannot remedy on any
              relevant timeline. The shale patch surrendered drilling capacity when oil sat at $55 in late 2025. Those rigs do
              not return in weeks.
            </p>

              The IEA&apos;s 400-million-barrel emergency release — the largest in history — stabilized prices briefly before fresh
              Hormuz attacks pushed them back up. The EIA now forecasts Brent above $95 through Q2 2026. Fertilizer prices matter
              because urea is a natural gas derivative: energy shocks travel directly into food production costs with a one-to-two
              season lag.
