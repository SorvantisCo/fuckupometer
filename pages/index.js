This is not the ceiling event (no radioactive release confirmed), but it narrows the gap between the current score and the 96–100 nuclear threshold. Second: Brent settles at $112.19, a new war high, as Goldman Sachs projects elevated prices through 2027 — structural energy damage is now priced in at the multi-year horizon. Third: DIA assessment (1–6 month Strait closure) is now public — the "not inevitable" language from inside the Pentagon is the most consequential acknowledgment of the conflict\'s architecture since it began. Fourth: Kharg Island ground operation is actively being considered. A US ground presence in Iran would be a new structural floor condition.',

The "winding down" post and the troop deployment confirmation on the same day is the clearest illustration yet of the information environment: Trump\'s Truth Social is not the war. The DIA\'s "not inevitable" language on Strait reopening, combined with Goldman through 2027, confirms what the structural floor model has been pricing since Day 10: this is not a short war with a clean exit.

First: Iran\'s ballistic missile strike attempt on Diego Garcia — 3,800 miles from Iran — is the most structurally significant escalation since Hormuz closed. The deterrent architecture of this conflict just expanded by 3,800 miles and now encompasses a US-UK strategic bomber base. Second: Trump\'s 48-hour power plant ultimatum introduced the first ceiling-adjacent threat of the war — executing it would push X above 85 and risk Iran permanently closing Hormuz and targeting all Gulf energy and communications infrastructure. Third: Iran targeted Dimona and Arad — cities adjacent to Israel\'s nuclear research facility at Negev. The IAEA confirmed it is monitoring. Fourth: Asian equity markets confirmed structural economic damage at the regional level: Nikkei -3.5%, Kospi -4.9% in one session; both down ~12% since Feb 28. Score is 82 and not higher because the power plant ultimatum was not executed on Day 23.',
    yNote: 'TLM Assessment Day 23: 2.5/10. The Diego Garcia strike attempt is the structural event of the war. The Iranian deterrent perimeter now extends 3,800 miles from Tehran. Every US base in the Indian Ocean is now a plausible target. Trump\'s 48-hour ultimatum was a genuine ceiling-adjacent moment — if executed, it would have triggered the largest oil supply disruption since the Strait closed and a direct attack on Iranian civilian infrastructure. Every unfollowed ultimatum narrows the credibility of the next one. The 22-nation coalition statement with no ships is the diplomatic equivalent of "we\'ll get back to you." Sen. Murkowski\'s public posture is the first GOP senatorial crack in the war\'s political architecture.' },

Event push falls from +23 to +18: the 5-day pause on power plant strikes removes the immediate ceiling-adjacent threat that drove Day 23\'s score into 81+ territory. WTI dropped 8% and markets surged — the largest single-session market relief of the war. The 5 points of retreat reflect a genuine diplomatic channel opening, even if contested. Score does not fall further because: (1) Iran publicly denied any talks occurred and characterized the pause as "backing down"; (2) US-Israeli strikes on Tehran continued on Day 24 itself; (3) Iran introduced a new escalation threat — mining all Gulf communications lines if its coasts are attacked; (4) all 9 structural floor conditions remain active and no reversal criteria have been met; (5) the 5-day window is a postponement, not a resolution.',
    yNote: 'TLM Assessment Day 24: 3.0/10. The diplomatic channel is real even if Iran is publicly denying it. That\'s not unusual — both sides have incentives to manage domestic optics on any negotiation opening. But the structural reality has not changed: the Strait is closed, the mine-clearance ships are in Malaysia, the newer Iranian arsenal is undeployed, and GCC trust is fractured. The 5-day window is the most important thing to watch. If it produces a genuine Hormuz reopening framework, X falls. If Day 29 arrives with the Strait still closed and the power plant threat reinstated, X returns to 82+ immediately. The market is pricing a ceasefire. The structural model is pricing a pause.' },

    xNote: '78/100: Floor is 59 (all 9 structural conditions active — no reversal criteria met). Event push of +19. Score moves up 1 from Day 24, not down, for a straightforward reason: the market corrected its own overcorrection. Brent bounced back above $100 and WTI back toward $95 after yesterday\'s 10% drop — the market re-pricing the gap between "almost all points of agreement" and an ongoing kinetic reality in which Iran fired new missiles at Tel Aviv on Day 25 and the IRGC dismissed diplomacy in real time as a battlefield distraction. Israeli Defense Minister Katz confirmed "full force" strikes continue. An Israeli official told CNN a deal "does not appear to be tangible right now" and that Iran is "not in any concession mode." The Pakistan mediation lane is real — Iran confirmed to CBS it received US points through intermediaries — but it is a relayed message, not a framework, and it belongs on the Y axis, not the X axis. None of the 9 structural floor conditions moved. The Strait remains closed. The mine-clearance ships remain in Malaysia.',
    yNote: 'TLM Assessment Day 25: 3.0/10. The Pakistan go-between is the most concrete diplomatic contact since Larijani was killed — Iran\'s acknowledgment that it received US points through mediators is real. But "received points" is one step above silence. It is not a counterproposal. It is not a framework. And a ceasefire in this conflict requires two separate decisions from two actors running independent military policies: the US, which imposed a 5-day pause on power plant strikes, and Israel, which confirmed full-force operations with thousands of targets remaining and plans for several more weeks. Those are not the same decision. If Pakistan hosts an in-person meeting and Iran tables a counterproposal, Y moves to 3.5. Until then, the lane exists but nothing is moving through it.' },

The diplomatic channel is more concrete — the US delivered a formal 15-point action list via Pakistan; Iran responded with 5 counter-conditions — but Iran\'s conditions clarify that the gap between positions is structural, not tactical. Iran\'s demand for sovereignty over the Strait of Hormuz is not a negotiating position. It is a demand that the US accept permanent Iranian control over 20% of global oil flow. Iran FM explicitly confirmed Iran has not engaged in talks and does not plan to. WTI fell on Trump\'s claims of negotiations — the third time the market has corrected a Trump diplomatic claim this war.',

Iran\'s counter-conditions include war reparations and Hormuz sovereignty — two structural non-starters.

First: Iran\'s Parliament is actively formalizing a Hormuz toll regime — the "Tehran tollbooth." Ships reported charged $2M+ to use Iran\'s alternate channel. If this becomes law, the selective closure transitions from a wartime measure to a permanent geopolitical institution. Second: Trump extended the power plant ultimatum for the third time — now to April 6 — after the original 48-hour deadline issued Day 23. Each extension narrows the credibility of the next one. Third: Iran FM confirmed on the same day as Trump\'s extension that Iran "has not engaged in talks to end the war and does not plan to." Pentagon considering 10,000 more ground troops (WSJ). Two killed near Abu Dhabi by ballistic missile debris. Saudi Arabia shoots down 18 drones.',

First: UKMTO confirmed no vessel incidents since March 19 — the longest attack-free period since the war began (8 days). Second: WTI fell ~3.5% on diplomacy expectations — market pricing an April 6 resolution. Score does not fall further because: (1) the structural floor is fully intact — no bilateral cessation confirmed, Strait remains closed to Western shipping; (2) Iran\'s selective transit formally extended to 5 nations (China, Russia, India, Iraq, Pakistan), cementing the arrangement architecture; (3) Bloomberg: negotiations are "an exchange of demands that neither side could expect the other to accept," with Iran legislating a permanent Hormuz toll regime in parallel.',
    yNote: 'TLM Assessment Day 28: 3.0/10. Y recovers from 2.5. The tollbooth legislation is real but Iran\'s Parliament has been making maximalist declarations all war — the IRGC and SNSC run the actual conflict. If the SNSC decides to deal, the Parliament bill is footnote material. The 8-day vessel attack pause is the most concrete behavioral signal since the war began — not a Trump claim, a UKMTO confirmation. Behavioral change without structural change is a lagging indicator, not a resolution. But it earns the point back. Hold at 3.0 pending April 6.' },

Event push of +22. Four compounding drivers. First: Houthis enter the war — first ballistic missile toward Israel from Yemen, triggering sirens in Beersheba. The missile was intercepted but the threshold has been crossed. The Red Sea is back in play. This is a potential new structural floor condition: if Houthi operations against shipping resume, the global shipping disruption extends to a second chokepoint simultaneously. Second: Prince Sultan Air Base struck — 10+ US troops wounded inside Saudi Arabia, first confirmed US casualties there. A refueler aircraft damaged. Third: Shahid Khondab and Ardakan nuclear-adjacent facilities struck; Iran warns of "playing with fire." Fourth: US intelligence confirms only ~1/3 of Iran\'s missile arsenal verifiably destroyed — the operational picture is materially worse than the administration\'s public framing.',
    yNote: 'TLM Assessment Day 29: 2.5/10. The Houthi entry is the structural event of Day 29. Even if it stays at one missile, the deterrent logic has changed: the US is now managing potential kinetic pressure on two simultaneous chokepoints — Hormuz and the Red Sea — with a carrier in Croatian drydock and mine-clearance ships in Malaysia. The US intelligence confirmation that only 1/3 of Iran\'s missile arsenal is verifiably destroyed is the second major tell. The administration\'s "ahead of schedule" framing is not supported by its own intelligence community\'s numbers. April 6 is nine days away. If the Strait is still closed and the Houthis are operationally active, that deadline will either be extended again or executed against a target set the US has been unwilling to hit for four weeks.' },

Second: WTI briefly crosses $100 and closes +5.46%, with Dubai physical crude at $126 — the physical-futures gap JPMorgan says "is unlikely to persist." Third: IRGC threatens Gulf university campuses — Texas A&M, Northwestern (Qatar), NYU (UAE) — with a March 30 deadline, opening a new civilian escalation domain. Fourth: Kuwait International Airport struck by drone, first major regional airport directly hit. Score is 82 and not higher because the Islamabad four-nation summit (Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi) is the most substantive multilateral diplomatic structure of the war, including Saudi Arabia\'s first constructive signal since trust was declared "shattered" on Day 20.',

The Islamabad summit and Saudi Arabia\'s re-entry into the diplomatic lane are genuinely new — Saudi participation is structurally meaningful, not parliamentary noise. Iran\'s 20-ship Pakistani concession is a behavioral signal that a negotiating counterpart exists on the Iranian side. But simultaneously: USS Tripoli arrives, Ghalibaf warns Iran is "waiting" for a ground invasion, IRGC opens a university threat with a 24-hour deadline, and Kuwait airport burns. Both sides escalating and signaling simultaneously. Y holds at 2.5 pending whether the Islamabad format produces a framework or another exchange of incompatible demands.

This is presidential public statement, not White House deliberation.

Third: Iranian politicians formally push NPT withdrawal — if executed, ceiling event probability rises sharply. Fourth: IEA confirms Hormuz closure is the largest oil supply shock in history.

But Trump simultaneously claims most demands agreed and openly weighs seizing Kharg Island in the same FT interview. A counterpart watching cannot determine whether they are negotiating a ceasefire or preparing to occupy Iran\'s main oil export hub. That ambiguity is a structural problem for the Y axis.

Third: Three F-15s down in Kuwait; nine countries now directly involved. Fourth: Iran\'s 87th attack wave launched by its navy — the navy Trump has repeatedly claimed is destroyed. Fifth: Trump issues new "completely obliterate all energy sources" threat, his fourth escalatory ultimatum since Day 23.

The Pakistan-China axis is real structural diplomacy — Beijing entering the mediation frame changes the weight of the effort. That is the floor on Y.

Iran\'s 87th attack wave from its "destroyed" navy is the operational tell: the war is not nearly as far along as the administration\'s public framing.

Analysts call it "a repetition of everything he has said" that "reveals he really does not have a plan." Second: NATO allies Spain, France, and Italy formally restrict US military operations — first formal alliance constraint on US warfighting this conflict, closing airspace and denying base access. Third: B-52 bombers fly over Iranian territory for the first time — market reads this as deeper operational commitment, not the wind-down Trump\'s speech described. Fourth: Asian markets open sharply lower (Nikkei -2.1%, Kospi -3.9%).

The driver is structural: three NATO allies formally restricting US military operations is not diplomatic grumbling, it is institutional action. When Spain, France, and Italy close airspace and deny base access, the alliance fracture moves from the political lane to the operational one — a genuinely new thing in this conflict. Combined with a primetime address that provided no diplomatic path, Iran FM at "zero trust," IRGC threatening US tech companies, and April 6 five days away with no framework in place, the path back is materially narrower than Day 32. The UK-led conference is the only genuine resolution lane still open. Watch item: if April 6 is extended again, Y holds at 2.0. If executed, X crosses 90.' },

BCA Research\'s Papic estimates the supply loss at 4.5–5M bpd now, doubling by mid-April when SPR releases and sanctions exemptions run out — "the largest loss of crude supply" in history. Societe Generale: $150/bbl possible in April. Macquarie: 40% probability of $200 oil if the war extends to summer. WTI: $103.69. Brent: $105.53. April 6 is four days away.

The "oil cliff" is an X-axis event, not a Y-axis one — it narrows the economic time window without opening or closing diplomatic lanes. Watch items: (1) April 6 — another extension holds Y at 2.0, execution pushes X to 92+; (2) NATO losing formal basing access in a fourth country drops Y to 1.5; (3) Iranian FM-level acceptance of ceasefire talks is the only reversal event on Y.' },

Trump immediately posts video of the collapse, then threatens power plants on Truth Social. 100+ legal experts issue war crimes warning. Civilian infrastructure targeting at a holiday event is a structurally distinct escalation from previous military strikes. Second: Hegseth fires Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George effective immediately, plus two additional general officers — 14th+ senior flag officer removed since Hegseth took office. Command coherence at the Army level is now in question while ground invasion planning is ongoing and a potential Kharg Island operation is on the table. Third: Iran strikes two Gulf refineries; IRGC announces hidden weapons stockpiles remain intact. Oil markets suspended (Good Friday) with Thursday\'s prints — WTI $111, S&P 500 -1.74% — as the last market signal available.',
    yNote: 'TLM Assessment Day 35: 1.8/10. Moving Y down from 2.0 on a specific mechanism: the B1 bridge strike during Sizdah Bedar produces a civilian-casualty image that is qualitatively different from previous strikes on military or industrial targets. Opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, who has called on the US and Israel to spare civilian infrastructure, and regime spokespeople are now reading from the same civilian-harm frame. When Iranian political opinion converges across factional lines — however briefly — the diplomatic space contracts. Negotiating against the backdrop of bridge rubble on a national holiday is harder than negotiating against the backdrop of bombed air bases. Y is not at 1.5 because Guterres\' direct intervention, the scheduled UN Security Council vote, and the UK Hormuz conference indicate international actors are still constructing an off-ramp. But the structural hardening is real and the window is narrowing.' },

Iranian drones reach deep into Kuwait — power plants, water desalination, a government building, petroleum infrastructure. Geographic expansion of IRGC retaliation beyond the Strait theater accounts for the increment above Day 35.',
    yNote: 'TLM Assessment Day 36: 1.7/10. Kuwait drone attacks are a qualitative escalation — IRGC is now willing to strike deep GCC infrastructure. Every increment of geographic expansion reduces the scope for a bilateral settlement and increases the number of parties who need to be bought off in any resolution architecture.

A 45-day ceasefire offered by three credible mediators is exactly the kind of face-saving architecture that de-escalation ladders are built from. Iran said no. That\'s not a maximalist opening bid — it\'s a structural constraint on the mediation space. Araghchi\'s flat denial of any negotiations while Trump claims talks are "going well" means one of them is lying about the current state of the channel.

That back-channel is now real and active, which moves Y. But the structural negatives are intact: Larijani is still dead, the tollbooth legislation is still institutionalized, and Mojtaba told his own supporters these talks are "just a delay until the Islamic Shiite state is established." That is not a man negotiating in good faith — that is a man managing domestic optics while buying time. The path to resolution is less impassable than it was yesterday. It is not open.' },

Event push of +14. Score drops 10 points from Day 39 on the ceasefire announcement — real structural de-escalation, not a Trump tweet. But the push falls, not to near-zero, because the structural damage is intact: WTI closed at $94.41 (-16.4%), the biggest single-day oil drop since April 2020. Spot Brent cargo came in at $124.68 — a $30 gap above the June futures price that crashed 13%. That gap is the physical reality: 187 tankers with 172 million barrels remain stranded inside the Gulf.

GCC attacks continued throughout the ceasefire day: Kuwait took 28 drone attacks, UAE 35, Qatar intercepted 7 missiles, Saudi East-West pipeline hit by drone.

The ceasefire is the highest-quality diplomatic signal this conflict has produced — SNSC signed, Pakistan brokered, Vance leading the Islamabad delegation is a serious commitment of US negotiating bandwidth. Markets believed it enough to produce the best Dow day in a year. But the framework started fraying within hours: Iran\'s Parliament Speaker Qalibaf publicly identified 3 violations (Lebanon strikes continuing, Iran airspace, Lebanon carve-out), and said bilateral negotiations are "unreasonable" given the violations. Lebanon is the structural sticking point: Pakistan announced it was included; Netanyahu confirmed it was not; Leavitt confirmed Lebanon is excluded. Iran cannot negotiate a bilateral settlement while Israel operates in Lebanon without cover — that is not a negotiating position, it is a logical constraint. Y is not at 3.5 because the path back requires Lebanon resolution, Hormuz actually opening, and a framework that survives the gap between the SNSC\'s version of the deal and the White House\'s version.

Hormuz has not reopened in any meaningful sense — Kpler confirms ship traffic has not materially increased above the wartime pace. Iran\'s Parliament Speaker Qalibaf identified 3 violations of the 10-point proposal and said bilateral negotiations are "unreasonable." The violations claim is from Parliament — the SNSC is the operational authority — but it signals the political environment in Tehran is not supportive of the deal architecture.

Parliament Speaker Qalibaf threatening to call negotiations unreasonable is a pressure move, not a withdrawal — the IRGC and SNSC have consistently run the actual war independently of Parliament\'s declarations. Lebanon remains the structural sticking point: Iran cannot formalize de-escalation while Israel operates in Lebanon with explicit White House confirmation that Lebanon is outside the agreement. Watch items: (1) whether Hormuz daily transit count moves materially by end of Saturday — Kpler data is the tell, not Trump Truth Social; (2) whether Islamabad produces a framework or another "productive conversations" cycle; (3) whether a fourth country formally restricts US military basing, which drops Y to 2.5.

Direct engagement doesn\'t guarantee a deal but it changes the shape of what a deal would require. The mine-clearance operation is also structurally positive: it moves Hormuz from politically blocked to physically remediable, which means any agreement can be implemented rather than just announced. The risk flag: US is reportedly demanding Iran surrender all enrichment including civilian/medical. That\'s a maximalist ask.

Iran\'s position is legible: keep jerking the strait, extract maximum concessions, avoid unconditional surrender. That is a coherent strategy for a weaker party. The US has no coherent strategy at all. Washington went into this conflict with three stated goals — military degradation, regime change, denuclearization — achieved partial progress on the first, none on the second, and is now maximally demanding on the third with no leverage theory attached. The Islamabad delegation had no authority to say yes to anything Iran could accept and no authority to say yes to anything the White House would ratify. That is not a negotiating failure. That is an institutional one. The US has two actual options: negotiate a deal everyone can live with, or convert military advantage into unconditional surrender. It has the capability for either. It is executing neither — running a third option that is not an option, which is to keep making threats until someone else solves the problem. Pakistan cannot solve this. Iran cannot solve this. The ceasefire window closing April 22 is not a forcing function if the party with the most leverage has no idea what it wants to force. Y is 2.0 not lower because the mine-clearance operation is real and Pakistan is still functional.

              The Strait of Hormuz handles approximately 20% of global oil flow. Its effective closure — triggered by the US–Iran
              conflict that began February 28 — has produced a supply shock that US domestic production cannot remedy on any
              relevant timeline. The shale patch surrendered drilling capacity when oil sat at $55 in late 2025. Those rigs do
              not return in weeks.
            </p>
            <p style={{ ...serif, fontSize: '14px', color: T.inkMid, lineHeight: 1.85, margin: 0, fontWeight: 300 }}>
              The IEA&apos;s 400-million-barrel emergency release — the largest in history — stabilized prices briefly before fresh
              Hormuz attacks pushed them back up. The EIA now forecasts Brent above $95 through Q2 2026. Fertilizer prices matter
              because urea is a natural gas derivative: energy shocks travel directly into food production costs with a one-to-two
              season lag.
