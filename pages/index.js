    xNote: '77/100: Score retreats 5 points from Day 23\'s ceiling pressure. Floor is 59 (all 9 structural conditions remain active — no reversal criteria met). Event push falls from +23 to +18: the 5-day pause on power plant strikes removes the immediate ceiling-adjacent threat that drove Day 23\'s score into 81+ territory. WTI dropped 8% and markets surged — the largest single-session market relief of the war. The 5 points of retreat reflect a genuine diplomatic channel opening, even if contested. Score does not fall further because: (1) Iran publicly denied any talks occurred and characterized the pause as "backing down"; (2) US-Israeli strikes on Tehran continued on Day 24 itself; (3) Iran introduced a new escalation threat — mining all Gulf communications lines if its coasts are attacked; (4) all 9 structural floor conditions remain active and no reversal criteria have been met; (5) the 5-day window is a postponement, not a resolution.',
    yNote: 'TLM Assessment Day 24: 3.0/10. The diplomatic channel is real even if Iran is publicly denying it. That\'s not unusual — both sides have incentives to manage domestic optics on any negotiation opening. But the structural reality has not changed: the Strait is closed, the mine-clearance ships are in Malaysia, the newer Iranian arsenal is undeployed, and GCC trust is fractured. The 5-day window is the most important thing to watch. If it produces a genuine Hormuz reopening framework, X falls. If Day 29 arrives with the Strait still closed and the power plant threat reinstated, X returns to 82+ immediately. The market is pricing a ceasefire. The structural model is pricing a pause.' },

              The Strait of Hormuz handles approximately 20% of global oil flow. Its effective closure — triggered by the US–Iran
              conflict that began February 28 — has produced a supply shock that US domestic production cannot remedy on any
              relevant timeline. The shale patch surrendered drilling capacity when oil sat at $55 in late 2025. Those rigs do
              not return in weeks.

              The IEA&apos;s 400-million-barrel emergency release — the largest in history — stabilized prices briefly before fresh
              Hormuz attacks pushed them back up. The EIA now forecasts Brent above $95 through Q2 2026. Fertilizer prices matter
              because urea is a natural gas derivative: energy shocks travel directly into food production costs with a one-to-two
              season lag.
